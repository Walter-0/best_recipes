## Project Workflow

How effectively did you plan, execute, and present this project?

**Meets expectations**

**Comments**: Great job with your user stories and wireframes. Make sure to keep
your ERD updated though, as it's missing your taggings/categories model. Also,
it's preferred to have a visual form (like using lucidchart.com or drawing it)
to help see how the app is structured (important as our apps grow).

## Technical Requirements

How well does your app demonstrate a grasp of the technologies introduced in class?

**Meets expectations**

**Comments**: Overall, it's clear you've got the fundamentals of Rails down, and
you did a great job implementing some new features like tagging and voting...
awesome!

That said, it did feel like there were a few cases in your code where
you weren't sure about the best way to do something, or maybe weren't able to
do exactly what you want (the primary example being that I can't un-tag a photo,
only delete the tag and its association with all photos). This isn't a bad thing
though, it means you're pushing yourself! Happy to go over some of these
concepts with you in our one on one.

## Creativity/Interface

How memorable and enjoyable to use is your app?

**Meets expectations**

**Comments**: I really like your idea, and I'm glad that you clearly spent a lot
of time on features in the back end. That said, I'd encourage you to spend just
a tiny bit more time thinking about the layout and design (not how it looks, but
how the features work) for your P3 / P4 so that you have a smoother user
experience.

## Code Quality

Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets expectations**

**Comments**: Overall, your code is good, but there is certainly some room for
improvement. See my comments in-line in your code for more detail.

## Deployment and Functionality

How accessible is your app to those who may want to explore it?

**Does not meet expectations**

**Comments**: I had to mark this as 'does not meet' because I can't find a link
to your app deployed on heroku, and submitting that link was one of the
requirements. As far as functionality is concerned, there's quite a bit of
useful functionality, but as I mentioned in the Interface section above, there's
definitely some room for improvement in terms of making the UX clearer on how
to use the features.
